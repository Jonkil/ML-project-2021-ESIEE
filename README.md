This folder contains a notebook with codes for data analysis and model training.

Input data must be in the same folder as the notebook. Output files will be written into this folder as well.

The "requirements.txt" file contains the packages that need to be installed into a dedicated Anaconda environment.

In terminal, move into the projects folder and run the commands:
- conda create --name ml_project --file requirements.txt
- conda activate ml_project
- jupyter lab
